# Privacy Policy for Digital Contents Library Tool

**Last Updated: May 20, 2024**

The "Digital Contents Library Tool" extension is committed to ensuring your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information within the extension.

### 1. No Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), browsing history, or user data to any external servers. Your privacy is our priority.

### 2. Local Storage of Data
All information processed by the extension, including:
- Custom API Base URLs
- User-defined Regex Patterns
- Product Codes and Local File Metadata
- User Preference Settings

is stored **strictly on the user's local device** using the browser's `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your computer and is only used to provide the extension's core functionality.

### 3. External API Requests
This extension allows users to define their own third-party API endpoints to fetch metadata. 
- When the extension fetches data from an API you have specified, it only transmits the identified product code to that specific service.
- If the "Translation" feature is enabled, the extension may send product titles or descriptions to the Google Translate API for translation purposes.
- We do not have control over, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of these user-defined third-party services.

### 4. Permissions Usage
- **Storage:** Used to save your settings and local library data on your machine.
- **Host Permissions (<all_urls>):** Used only to detect and highlight the ID patterns you have defined on web pages you visit. No browsing data is recorded or sent externally.

### 5. Data Deletion
Users can delete all stored data at any time by:
- Using the "Reset" button within the extension popup.
- Uninstalling the extension, which automatically removes all locally stored data.

### 6. Contact Information
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact us via our GitHub repository's issue tracker.
